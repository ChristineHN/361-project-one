			<h2>Coco</h2>
			<h3>Pompits<h3>
				<p>
					Coco is a pompits which is mix of pomeranian and spitz.
					He loves to play with his toys especially a ball.
					He barks whenever we have a visitor because he gets so scared.
					Sometimes he loves to go out but he gets scared easily so he only likes to go out for a walk when there are not a lot of people.
